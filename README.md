How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One way I can test software functionality and security is through unit testing. JUnit tests allow me as a developer to check each piece of a program to confirm that everything works as expected.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs begins when I'm designing a program. My first step is to figure out how user needs must be implemented to meet requirements. Additionally, user needs are an excellent starting point for testing. I start my testing by going through each requirement and testing it to ensure user needs have been met.

How do I approach designing software?
As I touched on above, I begin designing software by considering user needs. Once I have figured out how to implement the requirements set forth, I can begin to fill in the gaps in the program in a way that makes it fully functional.
